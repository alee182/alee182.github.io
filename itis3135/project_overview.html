    <h1>Backpacking Buddies Charlotte</h1>
  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The purpose of this website is to be a hub of information about the Backpacking Buddies club in Charlotte, which is a club for people of all ages and experience levels with backpacking to find groups to safely backpack and explore trails in North Carolina.
  </p>
  <p>
    The intended users of this website are individuals who are interested in backpacking, whether that be those doing research on backpacking or people who are interested in participating in the club's monthly hikes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The contents of the site will include a gallery of photos from the group's former hikes, an "About Us" page teaching more about some of the leaders in the group and about the group as a whole, a gear list page to help beginners get a better understanding of what is needed for a backpacking trip, and an informational page about the next club meetings, upcoming trips, and the logistics behind each.
  </p>
  <p>
    There will also be a spreadsheet for users to input their gear and gear information to save it for later as a checklist or weight calculator.
  </p>

  <h3>Homepage</h3>
  <p>
    The purpose of the homepage is to give the user a basic understanding of what Backpacking Buddies Charlotte is.
  </p>
  <p>
    The users of this page are extremely broad as it covers anyone who is interested in our club or backpacking in general. The content of this page will contain a short description as well as boxes with brief descriptions of upcoming events. There will be no data field validation or dropdowns.
  </p>
  <p>
    There will be arrows within each box that will take the user to a dedicated page for upcoming events.
  </p>

  <h3>Photo Gallery</h3>
  <p>
    The purpose of the photo gallery is to showcase images from previous trips and events for two user types. The first is for those who participated in those trips to have easy access to all of the photos taken. The second is to allow people who are potentially interested in trips to get a good understanding of what happens during the trip and all of the sights they will see.
  </p>
  <p>
    The content of this page will contain sections for each trip with a photo wheel that allows users to click through and see all of the photos from each trip. When a user clicks the arrow on the photo wheel, the next image from the trip will come up. There will also be a back arrow to go back to previously viewed photos.
  </p>

  <h3>About Us</h3>
  <p>
    The purpose of the "About Us" page is to provide in-depth information about the Backpacking Buddies club and its goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary users of this page are individuals who may not know a lot about the club and want to learn more. There won’t be any hyperlinks other than those in the navigation bar, and it will be a relatively simple page with no JavaScript.
  </p>

  <h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
  <p>
    The purpose of this page is to provide information about upcoming hikes, trips, and meetups for the club.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary users of this page are individuals who are interested in attending upcoming events. This page will have dropdown menus for each event that will expand upon clicking. There won’t be any data validation and no hyperlinks other than the navigation bar.
  </p>

  <h3>Gear Spreadsheet</h3>
  <p>
    The purpose of this page is to give users a list of needed gear for a backpacking trip and allow users to create their own printable spreadsheet.
  </p>
  <p>
    The page will also feature a total weight calculator for their backpack. The primary users are individuals who are planning on attending a backpacking event and need information about what to bring or want an organized method of preparation.
  </p>
  <p>
    There will be data validation within the spreadsheet so users input correct information in the correct area. For instance, in the weight section of the spreadsheet, the input must be an integer or float. A submit button will allow users to create a saved version of the spreadsheet that can be printed or saved.
  </p>

  <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
  <p>
    There will be two aspects of this project that include dynamic functionality. The first is a dynamic photo gallery in the page showcasing past club trips, allowing users to interactively view images from previous backpacking trips. An example of this would be the site: <a href="https://www.outdoors.org/adventures/" target="_blank">Outdoors.org Adventures</a>, which holds many photos from each trip that can be clicked on for more information.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second dynamic aspect will be the checklist/weight check for backpackers, where users can input all their gear and information to create a printable checklist and weight calculator. A simpler version of this will be based on: <a href="https://weighmygear.com/pack-weight-calculator/" target="_blank">Weigh My Gear</a>.
