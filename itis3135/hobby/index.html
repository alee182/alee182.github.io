        <section id="how">
            <h2>How to get started</h2>
            <p>Getting started is very easy considering the amount of equipment neeeded is very limited.
                When running the only gear you need is a good pair of running shoes and running atire. While any athletic wear
                is typically good for running it is important to purchase a good pair of running shoes.

            <p>When Getting started it is important to set goals and create a training plan to complete. First set a goal you'd like to achieve
                and create a realistic timeline for achieving it. Then research training plans that align with your schedule.

        <section id="why">
            <h2>Why you should Run</h2>
            <p>Running is a powerful way to boost your physical health, improving cardiovascular fitness, strengthening muscles, 
                and aiding in weight management. It also has significant mental health benefits, such as reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, 
                thanks to the release of endorphins. Additionally, regular running can enhance overall energy levels, improve sleep quality, and boost your immune system, 
                making it a holistic activity for both body and mind.</p>

            <p>Running fosters a sense of accomplishment and discipline, helping you build confidence and resilience as you achieve personal goals. 
            It also provides opportunities to connect with nature, explore new places, 
            and join a supportive community of fellow runners, making it a rewarding and social experience.</p>
