            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Austin Lee I am 19 years old and I have been running for over 7 years. I started running in middle school for 
                my middle school track team and have fell in love with hit ever since competing in high school and running recreationally in college!
                I love running at my local trail with my friends and talking while we run. My favorite events to run are the mile and the half mile which I would run 
                frequently at meets in high school.
            </p>

            <h2>Seasons</h2>
            <p>While you have the ability run during any season of the year some seasons create conditions
                that are better for running than others. When deciding which seasons of the year are best for outdoor running consider
                some of the following tips:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Try avoiding the extreme heat of summer and extreme cold of winter </li>
                <li>Mild temperatures typically making running easier</li>
                <li>Spring and Fall typically have the best running weather</li>
                <li>Running in the summer can be more challenging/slower due to high heat</li>
            </ul>
            <figure>

                <figcaption><i>Running in the fall is the best due to good temps!</i></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Competitive running seasons vary depending on the type of races and climate. Spring and fall are popular for marathons and half-marathons, as the cooler temperatures are ideal for long-distance events. 
                Summer often features shorter races like 5Ks and 10Ks, as well as track and field competitions, taking advantage of warmer weather for faster performances. Winter is typically reserved for indoor track events or cross-country races in milder climates, 
                while some runners use this time for base training to prepare for the upcoming spring season.</p>

            <p>There are a lot of different options for places to run whether it be indoor or outdoor find the one that
                works best for you. I always preferred to run outside in nature, typically at my local running trail. Here are some other places I've found particularly nice to run:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>At a local park</li>
                <li>Find a designated trail in your area</li>

        <section id="how">
            <h2>How to get started</h2>
            <p>To get started with running, begin by setting clear goals to understand your motivation, whether it’s improving fitness, reducing stress, or training for a race, 
                and establish realistic targets to keep yourself on track. Invest in proper gear, including a pair of 
                supportive running shoes and moisture-wicking clothing, to ensure comfort and reduce the risk of injury. Start slow by incorporating a mix of walking and running, 
                such as following a beginner-friendly program like couch-to-5K, to gradually build your endurance without overexerting yourself. </p>

                <figcaption><i>its important to get a good pair of running shoes</i></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Always warm up with 5-10 minutes of brisk walking or dynamic stretches before your run and 
                cool down afterward to prevent injuries and aid recovery. Finally, stay consistent by creating a manageable schedule, 
                aiming for 2-3 runs per week. It is important to focus on building a sustainable habit rather than pushing for speed or distance right away.
