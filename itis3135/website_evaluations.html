        <h2>Website evaluations</h2>

        <h3>Good - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/%2Fmarketplace/" target="_blank">Facebook Marketplace</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The contrast used is very good using white on dark blue or black on white text throughout making it easy to read</li>
            <li><strong>Repitition:</strong> Repitition is used throughout the site with different filters repeating and rows of postings repeating as you scroll down</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The structure of the sight is aligned into two columns one taking up 2/3 space and the other 1/3 all of the postings and filters have aligning elements throughout</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Good proximity is used with padding and margins appropriately used throughout making everything comfortably spaced and easy to read/look at.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bad - <a href="https://arngren.net/" target="_blank">ArnGren</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contrast:  </strong> Overall the contrast is actually pretty good. The text is dark colors and the background is light. However some pictures have hard to read text because of colors</li>
            <li><strong>Repitition:</strong> Elements repeat However not in a consistent. Its just a big jumble of pictures and words. I can't tell where the different sections end and others start.</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> No alignment is shown with all listings being in inconsistent places.</li>
            <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> all of the elements on this website are to close to each other making the page feel overwhelming.</li>
        </ul>
